# Levenshtein_API_with_ngrok (Built on Google colab)
I built the code by using google colab so if you don't have heavy laptops and if you want to learn the python then please switch to google colab.

Using Lveneshtein distance for string match like "Vikas" is how much similar to "Vikash"

Also, we build API and we can check only on our system but I want to use on different systems even on mobile.
So, I tried the ngrok with google colab and it works on proxy and tunnels so anyone can access it till my system is turned on. Also, we need to keep refreshing it in every 8 hours.

In ngrok sometimes you will get 502 bad gateway error then you should need to choose ngrok.kill() command to kill all active session.

The infomation in excel file i have taken from wikipedia.
